# A few words about OpenXPKI Release 1.0.0 #

Today, we are creating the OpenXPKI Release 1.0.0.

Since even release numbers often imply a subjective level of code stability,
it should be mentioned that no formal release process was made for 1.0.0, but
that it only marks the move from Subversion to Git. In addition,
it is the basis for the new release model based on
[gitflow](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow). 

We could have chosen 0._something_, but felt that 1.0.0 would give us a cleaner
cut.
