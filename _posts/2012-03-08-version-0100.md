# A few words about OpenXPKI Release 0.10.0 #

Today, we are creating the OpenXPKI Release 0.10.0, which is actually more
of a milestone than an official release.  It  marks the move from Subversion
to Git and serves as the basis for the new release model based on
[gitflow](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow).
