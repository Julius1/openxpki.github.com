<p>The foundation builds the base of our organizational structure.
           The major building block is the charter which is currently being
           prepared. We will discuss the charter on the OpenXPKI users
           mailing list. The major management unit of the foundation is
           the board as defined by the charter. The foundation forms a full
           democratic management approach for an Open Source community.
           If you have any comments about this feel free to start a
           discussion on our users list.
</p>
<p>We forked away from OpenCA because of the several problems with
           organization and management of the project. We created a formal body
           around the new project to avoid such problems in the future.
           The foundation is not registered today and thus it is not a
           registered legal entity. We only will do so if this is required
           to protect the project.

<p>As of today there are three major documents:</p>

<li><a href="sw_license.txt">The Software License</a></li>
<li><a href="doc_license.txt">The Documentation License</a></li>
</ul>
